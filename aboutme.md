My name is Peter Huynh. I am a programmer and I have the following qualities:

- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (class of 2022).
- I am fast at grasping the problem.
- I learn (or approach any problems/issues) most through listening and asking questions.
- Responsibilities is my top priority. I always put extra effort and time for any project that I am assigned to.

### My History

Before I decided to switch my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science, whoever I talked to, when the conversation reach the topic of coding, they always said computer were cool and stuff until you started learning how they work. I thought that they were exagerrating and was I so right. One of the required class I had to take was Introduction to Programming and I fell in love with it. The idea of being able to create something and have it worked is always the most fascinating to me. The more I program the more I learn about how everything around me works. It is a great feeling to understand rather than to wonder (though wondering is great too because it motivates me to try to understand).
